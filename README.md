Random projects I've done in my free time. 

Interactable Grid
  - What it says on the tin, a simple grid that you can click on do change how it looks. I made this to get a basic idea of swing. 
A Star Algorithm
  - I made this to practice with pathfinding algorithms. It can also generate mazes to test pathfinding. Both it and interactable grid follow a bunch of tutorials which I've credited in the comments. 
  - Left click changes spaces between open and closed
  - Right and middle click set the start and end point for traversal
  - Space key generates a random maze.
  - Enter key finds a path between the start and end tiles
